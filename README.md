# React native Todo app

This is a mini project to practice my React Native + Expo skills. Therefore the scope of this app is simple:

1. User can add item to todo list
2. In todo list, user can mark an item as completed
3. In todo list, user can mark an item as deleted
4. When item is completed, it will be moved from todo list to completed list
